# 2025-10-02 - Test Fixes and Documentation Updates

## Overall Task
Fixed all failing tests in the GPUI-TS test suite (8 failing tests across 5 files) and ensured the project builds cleanly with no TypeScript errors. Updated documentation to reflect fixes.

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Missing `emit` Method on Models (4 tests)
**Issue**: Models didn't have a callable `emit` function for ad-hoc events. Tests were calling `model.emit({ type: 'test' })` which failed with "emit is not a function".

**Root Cause**: The `emit` property was typed as `EmitNamespace<TEvents>` which is a mapped object type with event methods. When no events were defined, it was just an empty object `{}`, not a callable function.

**Solution**:
- Updated `EmitNamespace` type definition to be both an object AND a callable function:
  ```typescript
  type EmitNamespace<TEvents extends Record<string, any>> = {
    [K in keyof TEvents & string]: (...args: EventPayload<TEvents[K]>) => void;
  } & (<TEvent>(event: TEvent) => void);
  ```
- Modified `createEmitNamespace` helper to create a function and assign namespace methods to it:
  ```typescript
  const emitFunction = (event: any) => {
    registry.emit(modelName, event)
  }
  Object.assign(emitFunction, emitObj)
  return emitFunction as any as EmitNamespace<TEvents>
  ```
- Applied same pattern in `createModelAPI` where emit namespace is built

**Files Modified**:
- `src/index.ts`: Updated `EmitNamespace` type and `createEmitNamespace` function
- `src/index.ts`: Updated `createModelAPI` to create callable emit namespace

**Tests Fixed**:
- `test/edge-cases.test.ts` - Memory leak test
- `test/event-system.test.ts` - Two integration tests
- `test/index.test.ts` - Event system test

### 2. Fixed Schema Composition Event Preservation (1 test)
**Issue**: Global events added via `addEventToSchema` were lost when chaining builder operations (e.g., when calling `removeModelFromSchema` after adding events).

**Root Cause**: When `model()` was called on the schema builder, it created a new schema object but didn't include the `events` property. Later, when `ModelBuilder.events()` was called to add global events, it tried to merge with `newSchema.events` which was undefined.

**Solution**:
- Added `events: currentSchema.events || {}` when creating `newSchema` in both `createSchema` and `createBuilderWithSchema`:
  ```typescript
  const newSchema = {
    ...currentSchema,
    models: {
      ...currentSchema.models,
      [name]: { initialState }
    },
    events: currentSchema.events || {}  // ← Added this
  }
  ```
- Updated `ModelBuilder.events()` method in `createBuilderWithSchema` to handle both model-scoped and global events (matching the implementation in `createSchema`)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/helpers.ts`: Updated `createSchema` model builder
- `src/helpers.ts`: Updated `createBuilderWithSchema` model builder

**Tests Fixed**:
- `test/schema-composition.test.ts` - Integration test for chaining operations

### 3. Fixed Selector Test Issues (3 tests)

#### Test Expectation Fix
**Issue**: Test expected 2 visible todos after marking all items as completed with filter='active', but correctly got 0.

**Solution**: Updated test to change filter to 'all' before checking visible todos:
```typescript
app.models.todos.update(state => {
  state.items[1].completed = true
  state.filter = 'all'  // ← Added this
})
```

**Files Modified**: `test/selectors.test.ts`

#### Custom Equality Function Fix
**Issue**: Custom equality function wasn't comparing selector results correctly, causing unnecessary recomputations.

**Root Cause**: The equality function receives arrays of selector results, not the raw values. With one input selector returning an array, the result is a nested array `[[1,2,3]]`.

**Solution**: Updated custom equality function to properly access the nested structure:
```typescript
const customEqual = (a: any[], b: any[]) => {
  const itemsA = a[0]  // Get first selector result
  const itemsB = b[0]
  if (!Array.isArray(itemsA) || !Array.isArray(itemsB)) return false
  return itemsA[0] === itemsB[0]  // Compare first elements
}
```

**Files Modified**: `test/selectors.test.ts`

#### LRU Cache Key Generation Fix
**Issue**: LRU cache was reusing keys after eviction, causing cache collisions and incorrect behavior.

**Root Cause**: The `set` method used `String(this.cache.size)` as the key. When an entry was deleted and a new one added, the size would be the same, causing key reuse.

**Solution**: Added a `keyCounter` field to generate unique keys:
```typescript
class LRUCache<T> {
  private keyCounter: number = 0

  set(args: readonly any[], result: T): void {
    if (this.cache.size >= this.maxSize) {
      const firstKey = this.cache.keys().next().value
      if (firstKey !== undefined) {
        this.cache.delete(firstKey)
      }
    }
    const key = String(this.keyCounter++)  // ← Use counter
    this.cache.set(key, { args: args as any[], result, timestamp: Date.now() })
  }
}
```

**Files Modified**: `src/selectors.ts`

**Tests Fixed**:
- `test/selectors.test.ts` - Three tests (GPUI-TS integration, custom equality, LRU order)

### 4. Fixed TypeScript Compilation Error
**Issue**: Unused import causing TypeScript error: `'directive' is declared but its value is never read`

**Solution**: Removed unused import from `src/advanced.ts`:
```typescript
// Removed: import { directive } from 'lit/directive.js';
```

**Files Modified**: `src/advanced.ts`

### 5. Updated Documentation
**Changes Made**:
- `README.md`: Added example showing `emit` is callable for ad-hoc events
- `README.md`: Updated API reference to clarify emit namespace is both object and function
- `README.md`: Enhanced `createSelector` documentation with options examples
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Added "Unreleased" section with all fixes
- Created `CLAUDE.md`: Entry point for AI agents linking to AGENTS.md
- Moved `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` → `docs/AGENT_SUMMARIES/2025-10-02 - Improvements and Enhancements.md`
- Moved `docs/CHANGELOG-IMPROVEMENTS.md` → `docs/AGENT_SUMMARIES/2025-10-02 - Changelog Improvements.md`

## Key Findings

### TypeScript Type System Complexity
The `EmitNamespace` type needed to be both an object with methods AND a callable function. This required using intersection types: `{ methods } & (function)`. TypeScript handles this well but the runtime implementation needs careful construction.

### Schema Builder State Management
The fluent builder pattern requires careful state propagation. Each builder method returns a new builder, and state (like events) must be explicitly carried forward through the chain.

### Selector Memoization
The equality function for selectors compares the **array of selector results**, not individual values. This is a subtle but important distinction when writing custom equality functions.

### LRU Cache Implementation
Using Map insertion order for LRU is elegant, but key generation must be external to the cache size to avoid collisions after evictions.

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- **Failed**: 8 tests across 5 files
- **Passed**: 263 tests
- **Total**: 271 tests

### After Fixes
- **Failed**: 0 tests ✅
- **Passed**: 271 tests ✅
- **Total**: 271 tests

### Build Status
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- Type checking: ✅ Passed
- Build: ✅ All outputs generated cleanly
- Type definitions: ✅ Generated successfully

## Lessons Learned

### Correct Approach
1. Make types callable by using intersection with function signatures
2. Always propagate state through builder chains
3. Test equality functions with the actual data structure they receive
4. Use external counters for cache keys, not derived values

### Wrong Paths Taken
1. Initially thought the emit method wasn't being created at all
2. Assumed test expectations were correct without verifying the logic
3. Didn't realize cache key collisions until tracing through the LRU logic

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more explicit types for EmitNamespace to improve IDE autocomplete
2. Document the builder state propagation pattern for future contributors
3. Add more tests for edge cases in selector equality functions
4. Consider optimizing the LRU cache implementation
