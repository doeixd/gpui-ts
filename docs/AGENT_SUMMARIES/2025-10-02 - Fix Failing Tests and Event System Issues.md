# 2025-10-02 - Fix Failing Tests and Event System Issues

## Summary
Fixed critical issues in the GPUI-TS codebase that were preventing the event system from working properly. The main problems were duplicate keys in object literals causing methods to be overridden, leading to incomplete functionality.

## Key Findings
- **Duplicate Keys Issue**: The schema builder had duplicate "events" keys in ModelBuilder objects, causing the global events method to override the model events method, preventing model-specific events from being stored.
- **Interface Duplicates**: ModelContext interface had duplicate method definitions (notify, batch, effect, schedule) which could cause confusion and potential issues.
- **API Inconsistencies**: The event system API was inconsistent between global events and model events, requiring careful ordering in test cases.
- **Syntax Errors**: infinite-resource.ts had duplicate class declarations and incomplete code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Events Keys in Schema Builder (`src/helpers.ts`)
- **Problem**: ModelBuilder had duplicate "events" properties - one for model events and one for global events pass-through.
- **Solution**: Removed the global events pass-through from ModelBuilder to prevent overriding the model events method.
- **Impact**: Model events are now properly stored in `schema.models[modelName].events`.

### 2. Cleaned Up ModelContext Interface (`src/index.ts`)
- **Problem**: Duplicate method definitions (notify, batch, effect, schedule) in ModelContext interface.
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate method declarations.
- **Impact**: Cleaner interface definition, no functional change.

### 3. Removed Duplicate Emit Method (`src/index.ts`)
- **Problem**: createModelAPI had duplicate "emit" properties in the returned object.
- **Solution**: Removed the redundant emit function since the typed emit namespace is already provided.
- **Impact**: No duplicate methods in ModelAPI instances.

### 4. Fixed Syntax Error in Infinite Resource (`src/infinite-resource.ts`)
- **Problem**: Duplicate InfiniteScrollDirective class declaration and incomplete code.
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate/incomplete class and ensured proper export.
- **Impact**: File compiles correctly, infinite scroll directive works.

### 5. Adjusted Test Cases (`test/helpers.test.ts`)
- **Problem**: Tests were calling .events() after .model(), expecting global events, but the API requires .events() before .model() for global events.
- **Solution**: Reordered test cases to call .events() before .model() for global events.
- **Impact**: Tests now pass, confirming global events work correctly.

## Results
- **Event System Integration Tests**: All 8 tests now pass (previously failing).
- **Schema Builder Tests**: All 26 tests now pass (previously 3 failing).
- **Overall Test Suite**: Reduced failing tests from 15 to 12 (some remaining in dynamic schema management, unrelated to this fix).
- **Event System**: Model-specific events now work correctly with typed emit/on namespaces.

## API Design Notes
- **Model Events**: Defined using `.model('name', state).events({...})` - stored in `schema.models[name].events`
- **Global Events**: Defined using `.events({...}).model('name', state)` - stored in `schema.events`
- **Model API**: Provides `model.emit.eventName()` and `model.on.eventName()` for type-safe event handling

## Next Steps
- The remaining 12 failing tests are in dynamic-schema.test.ts related to runtime event addition, which may require separate fixes.
- Consider unifying the event API to make it more intuitive (e.g., always use .events() for events regardless of position).
- Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases in event handling.

## Lessons Learned
- Duplicate keys in JavaScript objects silently override properties, leading to subtle bugs.
- Careful API design is crucial for fluent interfaces to avoid confusion between similar methods.
- Test ordering can reveal API design issues.
- Incremental fixing with focused changes is more effective than large refactors.
