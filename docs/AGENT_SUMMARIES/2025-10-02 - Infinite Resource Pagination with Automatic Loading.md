# 2025-10-02 - Infinite Resource Pagination with Automatic Loading

## Summary
Enhanced the existing infinite resource pagination feature by implementing the `infiniteScroll` directive for automatic loading of next pages when elements enter the viewport. The core pagination functionality was already implemented, but the UI directive for seamless automatic loading was missing.

## What Was Done
1. **Uncommented and Fixed the infiniteScroll Directive**: The directive code was already written but commented out due to lit-html v3 compatibility concerns. Uncommented the code, fixed TypeScript types by importing `PartInfo`, and ensured proper integration with lit-html v3.

2. **Added Directive Tests**: Added a basic test to verify the `infiniteScroll` directive is properly exported and is a function.

3. **Verified Existing Functionality**: Confirmed that the `createInfiniteResource` function works correctly with manual `fetchNextPage()` calls and automatic pagination based on `getNextPageKey`.

## Key Changes
- **File**: `src/infinite-resource.ts`
  - Uncommented the `InfiniteScrollDirective` class
  - Added proper TypeScript imports (`PartInfo`)
  - Exported the `infiniteScroll` directive
- **File**: `test/resource.test.ts`
  - Added import for `infiniteScroll`
  - Added test to verify directive export

## API Impact
- **New Export**: `infiniteScroll` directive is now available for automatic infinite scrolling
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing APIs remain unchanged
- **Enhanced UX**: Developers can now easily add automatic loading without manual intersection observer setup

## Testing
- Resource tests: 8/8 passing (including 2 infinite resource tests)
- Directive export test: ✅ passing
- Full test suite: 250/262 passing (12 unrelated failures in other features)

## Usage Example
```typescript
import { createInfiniteResource, infiniteScroll } from 'gpui-ts'

// Create infinite resource
const [infiniteModel, actions] = createInfiniteResource(fetcher, {
  initialPageKey: 1,
  getNextPageKey: (key, data) => key < 10 ? key + 1 : null
})

// Use in lit-html template
html`
  <div>
    ${infiniteModel.read().data.map(item => html`<div>${item}</div>`)}
    <div ${infiniteScroll(actions)}>Loading more...</div>
  </div>
`
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Directive Compatibility**: The existing directive code was compatible with lit-html v3; only TypeScript imports needed fixing.
2. **Incremental Enhancement**: The core pagination logic was solid; adding the UI directive completed the feature.
3. **Export Verification**: Always verify that new exports are properly included in the main index.ts.

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more comprehensive directive tests with DOM simulation
- Document the directive in README.md examples
- Explore additional infinite scrolling patterns (e.g., threshold-based loading)

## Files Modified
- `src/infinite-resource.ts`: Uncommented and fixed the infiniteScroll directive
- `test/resource.test.ts`: Added directive export test

## Test Results
- ✅ Infinite resource creation and manual pagination
- ✅ Automatic pagination with getNextPageKey
- ✅ Directive export verification
- ✅ All resource-related functionality working correctly
