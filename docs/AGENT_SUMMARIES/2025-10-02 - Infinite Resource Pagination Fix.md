# 2025-10-02 - Infinite Resource Pagination Fix

## Summary
Fixed a critical bug in the `createInfiniteResource` implementation where the `fetchNextPage()` function was not triggering subsequent page fetches. The issue was that `pageKeyModel.update()` was not notifying subscribers, preventing the reactive resource system from refetching data.

## What Was Done
1. **Identified the Root Cause**: The `fetchNextPage()` function was correctly calculating the next page key and updating the `pageKeyModel`, but the update wasn't triggering the resource's reactive fetcher.

2. **Debugged Step-by-Step**:
   - Added extensive logging to trace the execution flow
   - Verified that `fetchNextPage()` was called and calculating keys correctly
   - Confirmed that `pageKeyModel.update()` was executing but not triggering `onChange` callbacks
   - Discovered that `update()` modifies state but doesn't notify subscribers, while `updateAndNotify()` does both

3. **Applied the Fix**: Changed `pageKeyModel.update()` to `pageKeyModel.updateAndNotify()` in the `fetchNextPage` function.

4. **Cleaned Up**: Removed all debug logging and verified the fix works correctly.

## Key Changes
- **File**: `src/infinite-resource.ts`
- **Change**: In `fetchNextPage()`, replaced `pageKeyModel.update((state) => { state.key = nextPageKey; })` with `pageKeyModel.updateAndNotify((state) => { state.key = nextPageKey; })`

## API Impact
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Internal implementation fix that ensures pagination works as expected

## Testing
- The failing test "should fetch next page" now passes
- All resource-related tests pass (7/7)
- Full test suite shows 233/240 tests passing (7 unrelated proxy API tests failing)

## Lessons Learned
1. **Model Update Methods**: The distinction between `update()` and `updateAndNotify()` is crucial:
   - `update()`: Modifies state internally but doesn't trigger reactive subscriptions
   - `updateAndNotify()`: Modifies state and notifies all subscribers

2. **Reactive System Debugging**: When reactive updates aren't propagating, always check:
   - Is the state actually being modified?
   - Are change notifications being sent?
   - Are subscribers receiving the notifications?

3. **Test Isolation**: The issue was only caught by the specific pagination test, highlighting the importance of comprehensive test coverage for complex reactive flows.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases in infinite resource pagination
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases (e.g., rapid successive calls to `fetchNextPage()`)
- The proxy API tests are failing but unrelated to this fix - those should be addressed separately

## Files Modified
- `src/infinite-resource.ts`: Fixed the `fetchNextPage` implementation
- `test/resource.test.ts`: Cleaned up debug logging

## Test Results
- ✅ Resource System tests: 7/7 passing
- ✅ Infinite resource pagination: Working correctly
- ✅ Full test suite: 233/240 passing (7 unrelated failures)
