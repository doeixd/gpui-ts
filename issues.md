## Issue Categories and Detailed Analysis

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Must Fix First - Core Functionality)

#### 1. Subscription System Broken
**Status:** âœ… FIXED
**Affected Tests:** Previously 12+ tests, now resolved
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- The `onChange` subscription mechanism was not properly queuing or flushing notifications
- Effect queue was using generic functions instead of structured objects
- Notifications were not being processed correctly in the flush cycle

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `ModelRegistry.update()` called `ctx.notify()` but the effect queue contained anonymous functions that weren't distinguishable
- `flushEffects()` executed functions without type checking
- State mutations weren't triggering proper notification cascades

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Restructure Effect Queue:** Change `effectQueue` from `Array<() => void>` to `Array<{ type: 'notify' | 'emit', modelId: string, event?: any }>`
2. **Update notify() Method:** Modify `ModelContext.notify()` to push `{ type: 'notify', modelId: id }` instead of a function
3. **Implement Typed flushEffects():** Add switch statement in `flushEffects()` to handle different effect types
4. **Test Incrementally:** Run subscription tests after each change to verify notifications work
5. **Verify Cross-Model:** Ensure `subscribeTo()` works between different models

#### 2. Event System Not Emitting
**Status:** âœ… FIXED
**Affected Tests:** Previously 11+ tests, now resolved
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- Event emission was conflated with state change notifications
- `emit()` method wasn't properly queuing events for processing
- Event handlers weren't being called due to queue processing issues

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Events and notifications shared the same queue but weren't differentiated
- `ModelRegistry.emit()` pushed functions that weren't executed properly
- Event propagation failed because of the subscription system issues above

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Separate Event Types:** Use the new typed effect queue with `{ type: 'emit', modelId: id, event: eventObject }`
2. **Update emit() Method:** Modify `ModelContext.emit()` to push emit effects
3. **Add Event Handling in flushEffects():** Add case for 'emit' type that calls event handlers
4. **Test Event Flow:** Verify events are emitted and received by subscribers
5. **Check Event Composition:** Ensure event transformation chains work (filter, map, etc.)

#### 3. Validation Always Returns Valid
**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED (Test Isolation Issues)
**Affected Tests:** 15+ validation tests still failing
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- Validation functions aren't being called or are throwing errors
- Schema constraints aren't properly structured or passed
- Error collection and formatting is incorrect
- Test state pollution causing false positives

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `constraints.validate` function exists but may not be called correctly
- Error handling in validation might be swallowing exceptions
- State passed to validator might be stale or incorrect
- Test apps share state between tests, causing validation to pass when it shouldn't

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Isolate Tests:** Create fresh app instances per test to prevent state pollution
2. **Debug Validation Call:** Add console logs to verify `constraints.validate` is called
3. **Check State Freshness:** Ensure `registry.read(name)` returns current state
4. **Handle Validation Errors:** Wrap validator calls in try-catch, return error messages
5. **Fix Error Formatting:** Ensure ValidationError objects have correct path, message, code
6. **Test Edge Cases:** Verify validation works with nested objects, arrays, and custom validators

### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority Issues (Essential for Production)

#### 4. Transaction Rollback Not Working
**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Affected Tests:** Transaction tests
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- Snapshot creation isn't deep cloning the state properly
- Error handling doesn't restore state correctly
- Nested transactions aren't handled

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `structuredClone()` might not work in all environments
- Transaction context doesn't properly isolate changes
- Rollback only happens on exceptions, not on explicit cancellation

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Deep Clone Implementation:** Use a robust deep clone utility instead of `structuredClone`
2. **Transaction Context:** Ensure transaction creates isolated context that doesn't affect global state
3. **Nested Transaction Support:** Track transaction depth and handle nested rollbacks
4. **Explicit Rollback:** Add methods to manually rollback transactions
5. **Test Error Scenarios:** Verify rollback works on thrown errors and caught exceptions

#### 5. Lens Composition Errors
**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED
**Affected Tests:** 1 failing test in lens-system
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- Lens composition doesn't handle type inference correctly
- Array operations (filter, index) have bugs in immutable updates
- Focused model updates don't propagate changes properly
- TypeScript types don't match runtime behavior

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `lens.compose()` doesn't properly chain getter/setter functions
- Array operations mutate instead of creating new arrays
- Focused model `update()` method doesn't use lens setters
- Type predicates and generics cause compilation issues

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Fix compose() Method:** Ensure getter/setter chaining works correctly
2. **Implement Immutable Array Ops:** `filter()`, `index()` should return new arrays/objects
3. **Update Focused Model Logic:** Use lens setters in `focused.update()`
4. **Type Safety:** Fix TypeScript generics for lens composition
5. **Test Composition:** Verify complex lens chains work (profile.settings.theme)
6. **Debug Array Operations:** Step through filter/index implementations

#### 6. Batch Operations Missing
**Status:** âœ… FIXED
**Affected Tests:** Batch tests now passing
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- `batchDepth` counter wasn't incrementing/decrementing properly
- Notifications weren't deferred during batch operations
- `flushEffects()` ran prematurely

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Batch context didn't properly track nesting
- Effect queue wasn't respecting batch boundaries
- State updates during batch weren't isolated

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Implement Batch Counter:** Track `batchDepth` in ModelRegistry
2. **Defer Flushing:** Only call `flushEffects()` when `batchDepth === 0`
3. **Context Isolation:** Ensure batch operations don't interfere with each other
4. **Test Nested Batches:** Verify batch operations can be nested
5. **Performance Check:** Ensure batching improves performance for bulk updates

### ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority Issues (Quality of Life)

#### 7. Cross-Model Subscriptions Broken
**Status:** âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Affected Tests:** Cross-model tests
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- `subscribeTo()` doesn't establish proper links between models
- Subscription cleanup doesn't work across model boundaries
- Dependency tracking between models fails

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Registry doesn't maintain cross-model dependency graphs
- Unsubscribe mechanisms don't handle multiple models
- State synchronization between models isn't reactive

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Implement Dependency Graph:** Track which models depend on others
2. **Cross-Model Registry:** Add methods to register inter-model relationships
3. **Reactive Propagation:** Ensure changes in one model trigger updates in dependent models
4. **Cleanup Logic:** Properly unsubscribe when models are destroyed
5. **Test Complex Relationships:** Verify A->B->C subscription chains work

#### 8. Computed Properties Not Updating
**Status:** âœ… FIXED
**Affected Tests:** Computed property tests now passing
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- Cache invalidation doesn't happen on state changes
- Dependency tracking isn't implemented
- Computed values become stale

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- No mechanism to detect when computed dependencies change
- Cache is never invalidated after initial computation
- Computed properties don't react to state updates

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Dependency Tracking:** Implement system to track which state properties affect each computed
2. **Invalidation Logic:** Clear cache when relevant state changes
3. **Reactive Updates:** Make computed properties automatically update
4. **Performance Optimization:** Only recompute when dependencies actually change
5. **Test Reactivity:** Verify computed values update when underlying state changes

#### 9. Lit-HTML Integration Issues
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED
**Affected Tests:** All 16 Lit-HTML tests now passing
**What Was Fixed:**
- Template update functionality was broken - `updateTemplate()` method wasn't properly re-rendering views
- View interface had `readonly template` property preventing template updates
- `renderView()` function was using closure variable instead of updated view template

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `updateTemplate()` used `Object.defineProperty` to update readonly property
- `renderView()` captured `template` in closure, ignoring view property updates
- TypeScript interface prevented mutable template property

**How Fixed:**
1. **Changed View Interface:** Made `template` property mutable instead of readonly
2. **Simplified updateTemplate():** Direct assignment instead of `Object.defineProperty`
3. **Fixed renderView():** Use `view.template` instead of closure variable
4. **Verified All Tests:** All 16 Lit-HTML integration tests now pass

#### 10. Memory Leaks
**Status:** PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Affected Tests:** Memory management tests
**What Might Be Wrong:**
- Event listeners and subscriptions aren't cleaned up
- Model destruction doesn't free resources
- Effect cleanup callbacks aren't called
- Registry holds references indefinitely

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- No explicit destroy/cleanup methods on models
- Event handlers maintain strong references
- Computed property caches aren't cleared
- Registry cleanup isn't comprehensive

**How to Fix / Go About Fixing It:**
1. **Implement Destroy Methods:** Add `destroy()` method to ModelAPI
2. **Cleanup Callbacks:** Ensure all subscriptions are unsubscribed
3. **Weak References:** Use WeakMap where possible to avoid holding references
4. **Registry Cleanup:** Implement comprehensive cleanup in ModelRegistry
5. **Test Memory Usage:** Use memory profiling to verify leaks are fixed
6. **Automatic Cleanup:** Consider automatic cleanup on model replacement
